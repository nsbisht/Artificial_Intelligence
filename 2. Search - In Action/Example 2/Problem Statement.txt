You start with the sequence ABABAECCEC, or in general any sequence made from A,B, C, and E. You can transform this sequence using the following equalities: AC = E,AB = BC, BB = E, CC = E, and E x = x for any x. For example, ABBC can be transformed into AEC, and then AC, and then E.

Your goal is to produce the sequence E.

Define an admissible heuristic for the problem and write an A* algorithm to solve the problem.
