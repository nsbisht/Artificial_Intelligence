Question: You start with the sequence ABABAECCEC, or in general any sequence made from A, B, C, and
E. You can transform this sequence using the following equalities: AC = E, AB = BC, BB = E, and E x
= x for any x. For example, ABBC can be transformed into AEC, and then AC, and then E. Your goal
is to produce the sequence E.
Give a complete problem formulation for the same.

Answer:

State Space
The set of all possible sequences made from A, B, C, and E.

Successor function
    Actions:
        Each possible transformation corresponds to an action.
        - AC = E,
        - AB = BC,
        - BB = E, and
        - E x = x for any x
    Cost: Number of actions (transformations) performed
    
Start State
ABABAECCEC or in general any sequence made from A, B, C, and E

Goal Test
Is the sequence E?
